Cheat Engine is a development environment focused on modding games and applications for personal use.
Adapted to Linux as my student project.

## Linux (hot)

### Basic Build Instructions

1. Download Lazarus 3.6 for Linux: https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads (32 or 64 bit) and install.
2. Clone the project and run `bash build.sh` 
3. Run Lazarus and click on `Project->Open Project`. Select `cheatengine.lpi` from the `Cheat Engine` folder as the project.
4. Click on `Run->Build` or press <kbd>SHIFT+F9</kbd>.
    * you can also click on `Run->Compile many Modes` (tip: select first three compile modes)
    * If you want to run or debug from the IDE on Linux you will need to run Lazarus as root.

5. That's all, enjoy.
